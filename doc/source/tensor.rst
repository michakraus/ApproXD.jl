Tensor Product of Spline Basis functions
========================================


The main user interface to approximate a function is called ``FSpaceXD``. There are several lower level functions which may be of interest to users, and they will be documented below.

Construction of ``FSpaceXD``
----------------------------

.. function:: FSpaceXD(ndim,coeff,bs)

	``ndim``: number of dimensions

	``coeff``: vector of approximating coefficients

	``bs``: ``Dict`` of length ``ndim`` with a spline basis function for each dimension.


Methods for ``FSpaceXD``
------------------------

.. function:: getValue(fspace,x)
    :noindex:

    ``fspace``: an ``FSpaceXD`` object

    ``x``: a vector of points, ``length(x)=ndim``



``FSpaceXD`` Usage Example
----------------------------

the example uses the :ref:`bspline-label` type.

.. code-block:: julia

	# set ndims
	ndims = 4

	# bounds
	lb = [-1.1,-1.5,-0.9,-1.0]
	ub = [1.2,1.6,0.9,1]

	# number of eval points and basis functions:
	# we require square basis matrices!
	npoints = [10,11,9,8]

	# number of basis funcs
	nbasis = npoints

	# splien degrees
	degs = [3,1,3,2]

	# implies a number of knots for each spline
	# remember the restriction that nknots == ncoefs
	nknots = [i => nbasis[i] - degs[i] + 1 for i=1:ndims]

	# eval points
	points = [i => linspace(lb[i],ub[i],npoints[i]) for i=1:ndims]

	# set up ApproXD
	bsp = Dict{Integer,BSpline}()
	for i in 1:ndims
		bsp[i] = BSpline(nknots[i],degs[i],lb[i],ub[i])
	end

	# set of basis functions
	d = Dict{Integer,Array{Float64,2}}()
	for i=1:ndims
		d[i] = full(getBasis(points[i],bsp[i]))
	end

	# set of INVERSE basis functions
	id = Dict{Integer,Array{Float64,2}}()
	for k in collect(keys(d))
		id[k] = inv(d[k])
	end

	#  get a function
	function f(x,y,z,w)
		sin(sqrt(x^2+y^2)) + (z-w)^3
	end

	y = Float64[f(i,j,k,w) for i in points[1], j in points[2], k in points[3], w in points[4]]

	yvec = y[:]

	# get coefs using the Tensor approximator function
	mycoef = getTensorCoef(id,yvec)

	# setup the FSpace
	fx = FSpaceXD(ndims,mycoef,bsp)

	rval1 = lb[1] + 0.3
	rval2 = lb[2] + 0.23
	rval3 = lb[3] + 0.111
	rval4 = lb[4] + 0.099
	println("approx value = $(getValue(fx,[rval1,rval2,rval3,rval4]))")
	println("true value = $(f(rval1,rval2,rval3,rval4))")





Outline of the de Boor Algorithm
--------------------------------

The main features of this implementation are

1. Avoids allocation of large tensor product
2. Exploits sparsity of spline basis functions

For a point of interest :math:`x \in R^d`, form the tensor product of univariate Bsplines of arbitrary degree ``k`` on each grid dimension and estimate a coefficient vector :math:`c` by solving the following system:

.. math::
	\hat{f}(X_1,X_2,\dots,X_d) &= \Phi(X_1,X_2,\dots,X_d)  c   , \text{where}\\
	\Phi(X_1,X_2,\dots,X_d) &= B_1(X_1) \otimes B_2(X_2) \otimes \dots \otimes B_d(X_d)  \\
	c &= \Phi(X_1,X_2,\dots,X_d)^{-1} f(X) \\
	X_1 &= \{x_{11},x_{12},\dots,x_{1n(1)} \}\\
	\dots \\
	X_d &= \{x_{d1},x_{d2},\dots,x_{dn(d)} \} \\
	\Phi(X_1,X_2,\dots,X_d) &= B_1(X_1) \otimes B_2(X_2) \otimes \dots \otimes B_d(X_d)

Here the :math:`B`'s are spline basis functions of arbitrary degree, and they are evaluated on the entire grid in each dimension. **An important restriction** in this setup is that the resulting Bspline basis function matrices must be square, i.e. there must be as many evaluation points as there are resulting basis functions (given ``n`` evaluation points and a selected spline degree ``k``, this results in a predetermined number of spline knots and therefore basis functions.)

Once the coefficients are obtained, the function value is obtained via

.. math::
	\hat{f}(x_1,x_2,\dots,x_d) = c \times \Phi(x_1,x_2,\dots,x_d)

The problem here is that :math:`\Phi` quickly becomes very large; in fact so large that it becomes infeasible to even allocate it in memory, let alone solve the system. The approach implmented here never forms :math:`\Phi` and uses a very efficient approach to to solve the system. The algorithm is devised and described in
